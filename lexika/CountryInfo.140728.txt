<!-- CountryInfo.txt

CountryInfo.txt is a general purpose file intended to facilitate natural language 
processing of news reports and political texts. It was originally developed to identify 
states for the text filtering system used in the development of MID4, then extended
to incorporate CIA World Factbook and WordNet information for the development of
TABARI dictionaries.

OVERALL FORMAT:

This is almost but not quite XML: major fields are delimited with tags of the form
<tag>...</tag>. When there are multiple entries inside a tag, these are simply
delimited by individual lines, which is not XML but converting this would be a relatively 
simple exercise well within the programming capabilities of anyone who would be working  
with the program in the first place.

# indicates that everything following is a comment. Also see <Comment> and <Doc> fields below

This block of documentation, however, is delimited using XML &lt;!-- ... --&gt;

Names of the form {...} {...} indicate synonyms for the same individual. These are very
incomplete: see notes below on name forms.  

DATE FORMATS:

These are variations of the TABARI format. Dates have the form YYYYMMDD.
The following notations are used:
[date - date]  Occupied office during this interval
[>date]        Occupied office at time of last update to file
[<date]        Occupied office when first World Leaders code was coded, currently Jan-2003 
               [<Government> section only]
[B:date]       Birth date [YYYY0101 indicates this was known only to the year, though
               occasionally individuals might have been born that day]
[D:date]       Death date [same conventions as birth]

TAGGED FIELDS:

<Country>:     wrapper for individual countries
<CountryCode>: ISO-3166-alpha3 code. In some cases -- mostly former USSR and former 
               Yugoslavia -- this includes date restrictions
<CountryName>: Country name in English

<COW-Alpha>:         Correlates of War project alpha code. --- = no code
<COW-Numeric>        Correlates of War project numerical code. 000 = no code
<FIPS-10>:           FIPS-10 code (2 character code used in the U.S. government)  -- = no code
<IMF>:   			 IMF numeric code. 000 = no code
<ISO3166-numeric>:   ISO3166-1 numeric code. 000 = no code
<ISO3166-alpha2>:    ISO3166-alpha2 code --- = no code
<ISO3166-alpha3>:    ISO3166-alpha3 code --- = no code

<Nationality>: This contains one or more adjectival forms of the country name, plus
               any number of synonyms, both in English and other languages
               
<Capital>: One or more names for the capital city

<MajorCities>: usually cities with populations greater than 1-million; occasionally
               other major cities
               
<Regions>: Regions listed as WordNet meronyms

<GeogFeatures>: Geographical features listed as WordNet meronyms

<Leaders>: original source was http://rulers.org, with some additional updates from the
           CIA World Factbook. Sub-tags give the name of the position. Leaders are from
           roughly 1960 to around 2009. The translation programs assume that these are
           in chronological order. See note below on coding individuals who were leaders
           in more than one country (it happens...)
            
<Government>: Source was the CIA World Leaders website
                  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/index.html
              The title of the position as reported by the source follows the #
              the date must be preceded by a CAMEO actor code indicating the position.
              Governments are from Jan-2003 to Feb-2011, so a "<" indicates that the 
              individual was in office in Jan-03 and a > indicates in office in Feb-11.
              Ordering is arbitrary.
              See "Caveat" below on the date ranges.
              See comments in USA: this is provided by Rulers.org.


UTILITY FIELDS:

<Comment>: This is intended for multiple-line comments that are internal to the file and will
           not be transferred to an output file.
           
<Doc>: This is intended for single-line comments will be transferred to an output file as lines
       prefixed with #.


CAVEATS AND KNOWN ISSUES 

1. For starters, keep in mind that this is a very large file assembled from a variety of sources 
   by a variety of people (as well as automated programs which extracted information from sources 
   which often were almost but not quite consistently formatted), and it will DEFINITELY CONTAIN 
   ERRORS! -- see the list of known errors below.  And more generally, the smaller the country, 
   the more likely there are problems (cf. island micro-states). So use it with caution, and if 
   you find some mistakes (particularly big ones), please let us know (ideally including a 
   corrected version).
   
2. Constructing and determining equivalences of names is a huge issue. In most cases, you 
   will probably want to use these as a starting point for doing more sophisticated name 
   resolution, mostly to determine whether a partial name corresponds to someone on these
   lists (and, very occasionally, resolving a name that occurs in multiple countries to the
   appropriate country).
   
   The EU JRC-Names database notes:
   
	  64% of the names in JRC-Names do not have additional spelling variants. For 
	  28% of the names, JRC-Names knows two or three spellings. There are 3760 
	  entities with ten spellings or more, and 37 entities with over 100 spelling 
	  variants. The names with the most spelling variants are Muammar Gaddafi (413 spellings),
	  Mikhail Saakashvili (256) and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (246) (status July 2011).
	  
   This is for the full names alone -- various combinations of initials and partial names
   would probably increase this by at least a factor of four.

3. Note that this uses a UTF-8 encoding, so the names do not include diacritical marks. 
   Sorry, but in the process of converting various file formats, we just couldn't keep 
   track of these consistently, so we dropped them. As does the current version of 
   JRC-Names,so probably that was probably the right call. A future version of JRC-Names 
   may have these, and this could be used to recover the original form[s >20030101].

4. If an individual is a leader in more than one country (which happens for some colonial and EU
   administrators), code the term and B/D information for one of the terms in the <Leaders>
   block and then code the additional information in the <Government> block in that same country: 
   the latter block allows the specification of any code. The translate.countryinfo.pl program 
   [see info below] will then combine these. See <CountryCode>AIA</CountryCode> for an example.
   
   Conversely, B/D: information for individuals in <Government> can be included in the <Leaders>
   block and will be incorporated.
   
5. We incorporated the World Leaders pdfs from Jan-2003 to Feb-2011, which were all that
   were available at the time. As of Jan-2012, these are now available back to Jan-2001 and
   could be added to the file, as could the more recent updates. If someone is so inclined.
   
6. If you convert this to a syntactically correct XML file, we'd appreciate receiving
   a copy of that (and, while you are at it, the code for doing the conversion?)
   
7. We have introduced three new 3-letter suffixes that identify autonomous territories (AUT), 
   declared but unrecognized states (UNR), and territories or states occupied by foreign 
   forces (OCC). 
   
   A territory is autonomous when it has achieved autonomy within the state through military 
   force or other means, but has not declared itself as an independent state. Two examples 
   of this are Eritrea and South Sudan. Both achieved de facto independence from the states 
   they were controlled by before officially declaring themselves as independent states. 
   
   The UNR suffix is applied to states that have declared independence, but have not been 
   officially recognized by states in the international system. 
   
   The OCC suffix is applied to a state or to a territory within a state that has be occupied 
   by foreign forces.
   

KNOWN ERRORS IN THIS VERSION

** <Government> is incorrectly formatted in FSM
** <Leaders> and <Government> missing from MNE
** Empty <Government> blocks in CYM, GNB, ROU
** Yugoslavian governments still need work; much of this is commented out. Someone with
   a specific need for this information and the patience to resolve it all needs to go
   through it.


AVAILABLE ANCILLARY PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES 

translate.countryinfo.pl: converts this to a TABARI 0.7 dictionary; it also uses the 
    [B: and [D: files to assign *ELI ("elite") codes
    
format.rulers.org.pl: translates lines from the Rulers.org format to this format

Matthias Heilke has some programs for translating text versions of the monthly CIA World
Leaders (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/) files into this 
format and reconciling these with the existing file; with a little more work this could 
be converted to a system which automatically updates the file.

The EU Joint Research Centre (those great folks who give us European Media Monitor)
maintains a very large and multi-lingual list of political names at
 
            http://langtech.jrc.ec.europa.eu/JRC-Names.html.
             
This web site also links to an excellent paper on the technical challenges involved with 
name detection and resolution.

From Vincent Arel-Bundock:

The "countrycode" package for R includes a set of regular expressions which can be used to 
match country names in character strings to country codes.

# Note: The CIA is prohibited by Executive Order 12333 [as amended] from collecting information on 
#       US citizens -- despite what you've seen in the movies -- and consequently the World Leaders 
#       database does not have information on the USA. These entries are from Rulers.org, hence the
#       B/D fields. There are also *considerably* more leaders on that site if someone is interested
#       in adding them.
#       There are some very early birth dates here so this would be best processed with 4-digit years
